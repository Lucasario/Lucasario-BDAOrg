So, why did I decide to take this course?

Well, the thing that put this course on my radar was that I needed a requirement
to complete my Masters of Engineering in ORIE. But there were a lot of classes
that could have fulfilled that requirement, so why Bayesian data analysis?

There's two answers to that question. The first is that I've been a fan of probability
for a ling time. I aced probability in junior year of undergrad, and then helped the
teacher teach it the next year. Not only is it a really fun field of mathematics, as
I am a big fan of board games of chance, but it's also a highly useful field of mathematics. 
I ask you to find me one field of engineering for which computer simulation isn't used,
and computer simulation is nothing without probability, which is a long-winded way of saying
that probability is required for every field of engineering. 

That's only half the story, however. In the two seperate times I took intro to probability, there
was one topic that was mentioned, but was never covered in enough detail for me to understand.
If you haven't guessed it by now, that subject was bayesian versus non-bayesian probability. As far 
as I could tell, this bayesian versus non-bayesian probability was a debate on the level of AC versus
 DC, but again, Bayesian probability wasn't even covered. And the word "frequentist" was 
never even uttered. So I'm taking this could to learn about bayesian probability, learn more skills 
that will be useful both in my chosen field of energy engineering, and any other field I find myself working 
in.
